  ## **Project Overview:**

  This project was conducted as part of a Business Intelligence Analyst role at Clinipet, focusing on data from HealthTail, a large veterinary hospital. The objective was to derive 
  actionable insights into pet diagnoses, medication spending, and disease trends to inform operational and strategic decisions.

  ## **Objectives:**

  * Understand diagnosis and medication spending patterns.
  * Analyze disease trends by breed and pet type.
  * Provide management with a real-time dashboard to track key metrics.
 
  ## **Tools & Technologies:**

  Google BigQuery – Data storage and SQL querying,
  SQL – Data cleaning and analysis,
  Looker Studio – Dashboard creation and data visualization.

  ## **Project Requirements:**

  1.Cleaning the data & creating aggregated tables using SQL.
  2.Answering research questions using SQL.
  3.Creating interactive report in Looker Studio.

  ## **ETL Plan:**

  * Extracted raw CSV files from HealthTail’s system and imported into BigQuery.

  * Transformed data using SQL:

      * Cleaned missing values and standardized formats (e.g., pet types, dates).

      * Created derived fields (e.g., diagnosis category, monthly trends).

      * Joined datasets (e.g., visits, medications, pets).

  * Loaded cleaned tables into BigQuery for analysis and Looker Studio reporting.

  * Validated data integrity through record counts, date range checks, and sample spot-checks.
